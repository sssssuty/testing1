            <div class="regularfont1gray innersectionend">
                Founded in 1914, MSA is a global leader in safety products for personal and facility protection. Serving clients in over 140 countries, MSA provides both <a style="color:#222;">hardware and software solutions</a> across various industries, including oil & gas, utilities, healthcare, construction, fire service, mining, and manufacturing.<br><br>
                For this project, we are focusing on <a style="color:#222;">MSA's Connected Work Platform</a>, which integrates <a style="color:#222;">the ALTAIR io4 portable gas detector with The Grid software</a>. This combination enhances worker visibility and safety, streamlines compliance, and boosts the productivity of gas detection programs. The io4 Portable Gas Detector, designed for use in confined spaces, collects crucial data such as gas readings, calibration status, and bump test results.

            <div class="largefont3 innersectiontitle" >The Oil and Gas Industry<br><br></div>
            <div class="regularfont1gray innersectionend">
                <a style="color:#222;">The oil and gas sector is immensely profitable</a>, generating $4 trillion in 2022 alone, with a consistent daily profit of $2.8 billion over the past 50 years. Product development in this area embodies the famous quote of “Don’t dig for gold, sell shovels.”<br><br>
                <a style="color:#222;">The safety conditions in the oil and gas sector have greatly improved, but gaps remain.</a> The U.S. Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) noted that the lack of regulations for onshore oil and gas operations contributed to past incidents, especially compared to offshore regulations. As a result, CSB recommended that OSHA require a performance-based safety management system for the industry. A safety manager reflected, "Twenty years ago, workers were seen as replaceable. My goal now is to minimize their risk and ensure they return home safely." He is now supported by flame-resistant clothing, PPE, and improved procedures from his employer, Falcon Drilling.<br><br>
                <a style="color:#222;">Incident reporting, while not a tool for immediate prevention, plays a critical role in safety management.</a> It systematically records safety events, allowing for analysis that can reveal trends, identify areas for improvement, and enhance overall safety protocols. According to the Heinrich triangle theory, for every serious injury or fatality, there are 300 near misses. This underscores the importance of capturing data beyond OSHA requirements, as repeated near misses can eventually lead to severe incidents.

            <div class="regularfont1gray innersectionend">
                The working and living conditions for these workers are challenging—they spend two weeks every month on-site, working 12-hour shifts each day, and sleep in small steel cabins at the edge of the site. Despite the demanding nature of the job, the pay is substantial, with annual earnings exceeding $80,000. However, the combination of hard work and high pay leads to a high turnover rate, which increases costs for companies due to the need for rehiring and retraining new employees.<br><br>
                We conducted user research sessions and field research to dive deeper into what's on the workers' minds.<br><br><br>
                <a style="color:#1F9054;">Insights include but not limited to:</a><br><br>
                <a class="largefont3" style="color:#222;">
                    #1. Workers carries multiple PPEs and devices on them. They don't want to carry more.<br><br>
                    #2. Workers' voices might be ignored by the management.<br><br>
                    #3. Workers might not report incidents because of scared of reprecussion, lack of oversights or misguided perception.<br>

                Depending on the site's size, there may be both safety managers and an operations manager, or just safety managers. Most of them live on-site alongside the workers. As their titles suggest, they are responsible for everything that happens on-site.<br><br><br>
