            <div class="largefont2">The big question is – <br>Why AI?</div>
        </div>
        <div class="projectsectiongrid2">
            <div class="regularfont1gray">
                While AI offers general benefits like automating repetitive tasks, enhancing data analysis, and providing personalization, integrating AI technology comes with significant costs—especially for an early-stage startup like ours. So, why did we decide to proceed with AI?<br><br>
                <a style="color:#222">The short answer is – it fits our users' needs.<br><br>
                    After conducting over 30 user interviews, we discovered that our users needed support in several key areas: 
                    <a style="color:#874CED">preparing personalized answers, receiving actionable feedback to improve their skills, and engaging in mock interviews that simulate real-life scenarios.<br><br>
                    </a>
                </a>
                <a style="color:#222">
                To ensure that integrating AI was the right decision, I evaluated its necessity using BCG's ADRA framework—Analyzing, Defining, Refining, Acting—to create a user-centric AI experience:<br><br>
                </a>
                
                Analyzing:
                Our AI system actively monitors mock interviews and practice sessions to assess users' strengths and weaknesses. It listens to responses, evaluates communication skills, and identifies areas for improvement.<br><br>

                Defining:
                We help users clarify their career objectives and the specific requirements of their target roles. By understanding their intent, the AI tailors the preparation process to focus on the competencies and skills that matter most for their desired positions.<br><br>

                Refining:
                The AI provides iterative feedback on performance, allowing users to adjust and enhance their answers. This continuous refinement helps them develop more precise and impactful responses to potential interview questions.<br><br>

                Acting:
                Beyond feedback, our AI suggests actionable steps to improve readiness. This includes recommending resources, setting up practice schedules, or simulating real-time interview scenarios to apply what they've learned.

            <div class="largefont2">Smart Yet Natural Experience</div>
        </div>
        <div class="projectsectiongrid2">
            <div class="regularfont1gray">
                Users preparing for interviews need an AI that can react quickly and accurately during a mock session, simulating the pressure and unpredictability of a real interview. However, they don’t want the AI to feel too human-like, which can trigger the discomfort of the uncanny valley—a sense of eeriness that comes from interactions that are almost, but not quite, human. Instead, they seek a tool that provides a realistic, fast-paced interview experience without trying to mimic human behavior too closely. It should feel natural and engaging, while still being clearly AI-driven.<br><br>
                <a style="color:#222">With these in mind, we designed Interview Mock with two principles: to provide an interview that feels authentic yet unmistakably AI-driven, and to ensure users can practice in a stress-free environment where they know they’re interacting with a smart system, not a human replica.<br><br></a>
                Real-Time Responsiveness: The AI listens carefully and responds immediately to user answers, simulating the pressure of a real interview where quick thinking is key. This fast, fluid interaction prepares users for high-pressure scenarios without overwhelming them.<br><br>
                Natural Flow, Without the Uncanny Valley: The AI engages in dynamic conversations, adapting its questions based on user input to maintain a natural flow. However, we purposefully designed the system to avoid human-like behaviors that could make the interaction feel unsettling or too close to reality. It remains smart and efficient, without pretending to be a human interviewer.<br><br>
                Tailored Questions, Realistic Scenarios: The questions posed during the session are tailored to the specific industry or role the user is preparing for, offering relevant and practical practice. The AI keeps the conversation realistic but avoids over-complication, focusing on simulating the types of questions and pressure users will face in actual interviews.

        </div>
        <div class="projectsectiongrid2">
            <div class="regularfont1gray">When users need to share personal experiences in a clear and structured way—such as for interviews or storytelling—they want a tool that helps them organize their thoughts without losing their unique voice. However, it’s also essential for the AI guiding this process to continually improve, delivering more relevant assistance based on user input.<br><br>
            We developed Brainstorm with AI to actively engage with users while gathering feedback, ensuring that each session improves both the user experience and the AI’s effectiveness.<br><br>
            Structured Assistance: The AI bot guides users through a step-by-step process, prompting them to share relevant details about their personal experiences. This structure ensures that users can transform their raw thoughts into clear, organized responses without sacrificing their individuality.<br><br>
            User Feedback Integration: At various points during or at the end of the conversation, users are asked to provide feedback on the AI’s assistance. For example, users might be presented with multiple options for phrasing or structuring their answers, and they can choose the one that best fits their needs. This feedback loop helps the AI tailor its future interactions more effectively, ensuring it delivers responses that are even more aligned with user preferences.<br><br>
            Continuous Improvement: Every piece of feedback users provide helps us fine-tune the AI model, making it more intuitive and responsive over time. As users interact with the AI and give feedback on its suggestions, the system learns from those inputs to offer better, more personalized assistance in future sessions.

        <div class="projectsectiongrid2">
            <div class="regularfont1gray">In interview preparation, users need more than just a place to practice—they want detailed feedback on the nuances of their performance, such as filler words, tone, and content clarity. Without accurate feedback, it’s hard for them to know where to improve or how their responses might be perceived by potential interviewers. To ensure that we’re providing value, it’s critical to test and refine this feedback continuously.<br><br>
            To make Practice Feedback as effective as possible, we constantly engage users in both in-person and online testing sessions, allowing us to fine-tune the functionality and evaluate the value it brings to their preparation process.<br><br><br><br>
            <img src="../../assets/enterview_testing.jpg" class="imgregular">
            Testing Our MVP <br><br><br><br>
            Detailed Performance Analysis: Our AI analyzes practice answers across multiple dimensions. Whether it’s identifying filler words that disrupt the flow, analyzing the content’s relevance, or assessing the tone for professionalism, the feedback is comprehensive and actionable. Users gain valuable insights into their performance, helping them improve not only what they say but how they say it.<br><br>
            User Testing Sessions: We’re committed to building features that genuinely help our users, which is why we continually set up in-person and online testing sessions. These sessions allow us to observe how users interact with the feedback and understand what aspects are most useful. Based on this direct user input, we refine the functionality and ensure the feature is meeting real needs.<br><br>
            Iterative Refinement: Every testing session gives us the opportunity to evaluate how well Practice Feedback is working and where improvements can be made. Whether it’s tweaking how feedback is delivered or adjusting the scope of what’s analyzed, we’re dedicated to iterating based on real-world usage and feedback.
