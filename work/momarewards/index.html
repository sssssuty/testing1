            <div class="subtitlecontent4">In 2021 and 2022, MoMA Design Store's <a style="text-decoration: underline wavy black 1px;">customer return to purchase rate</a> consistently stayed below the industry average of 16.5%. Also, there's a notable gap between the <a style="text-decoration: underline wavy black 1px;">online and physical shopping experiences</a>, which currently function as separate entities. Bridging this gap is essential for a unified and improved customer journey.</div><br>
            <div class="subtitleHeader4" id="challenge">Challenge</div>
            <div class="subtitlecontent4">The main challenge encountered in this project was the <a style="text-decoration: underline wavy black 1px;">constrained timeline and limited resources</a>. With the holiday season fast approaching, our team has a narrow window of just six months for ideation, research, design, iteration, build and test out the program, on top of our regular daily tasks.</div><br>

            <div class="subtitlecontent2">The MoMA Design Store, an extension of the esteemed Museum of Modern Art, exemplifies a perfect blend of art and commerce in the retail landscape. It offers an exceptional <a style="text-decoration: underline wavy black 1px;">online shopping platform</a>, where art enthusiasts and shoppers can explore and purchase a curated selection of design objects and art-inspired items from anywhere in the world. Complementing its digital presence, the MoMA Design Store also boasts <a style="text-decoration: underline wavy black 1px;">physical retail locations</a> in key international cities outside of New York City, such as Hong Kong, Japan, and Germany, broadening its global footprint and bringing its unique aesthetic to a worldwide audience.

In addition to these shopping avenues, the MoMA Design Store enhances its connection with art lovers through <a style="text-decoration: underline wavy black 1px;">museum memberships</a>, offering exclusive benefits and fostering a deeper relationship with the MoMA community. <a style="text-decoration: underline wavy black 1px;">Seasonal sales</a> events further entice customers, providing opportunities to acquire unique design pieces at attractive prices.

            <div class="subtitleHeader2" id="whattoimprove">Potential Opportunity?</div>
            <div class="subtitlecontent2">The team recognized the importance of strengthening its <a style="text-decoration: underline wavy black 1px;">bond with customers</a> and <a style="text-decoration: underline wavy black 1px;">enhancing its brand presence in the market</a>. To achieve this, we wanted to explore innovative strategies that would allow us to connect more intimately with our customer base. The focus was on understanding the customers' needs and preferences, providing them with a more personalized and engaging shopping experience. This final approach aimed to cultivate a deeper sense of community among its customers, encouraging their continued patronage and support. With a keen eye on long-term customer relationships, we were poised to take a significant step that would not only enrich the customer experience but also reinforce the brand's position in the competitive retail landscape.</div><br><br>

        <div class="subtitle2" id="ourapproach" >· Our Approach ·</div>
        <div class="subtitleHeader2" id="oursolution">Our Solution</div>
        <div class="subtitlecontent2">After the research, the team believes establishing our <a style="text-decoration: underline wavy black 1px;">loyalty program</a> as a strategic move will help to deepen customer engagement and foster long-term relationships. This program is envisioned as a tool for <a style="text-decoration: underline wavy black 1px;">rewarding repeat purchases</a> and a means to <a style="text-decoration: underline wavy black 1px;">create a community</a> of art and design enthusiasts who feel a personal connection to the MoMA brand. Also, having our own loyalty program besides the MoMA museum membership helps incentivize customers to return.
        </div>

        <div class="subtitlecontent2">Many retailers leverage <a style="text-decoration: underline wavy black 1px;">loyalty programs</a> to boost customer retention and sales by offering rewards and personalized experiences. These programs provide valuable insights through data collection on consumer habits, aiding in tailored marketing efforts and product improvement. Additionally, they foster a sense of community and brand loyalty, encouraging increased spending and positive word-of-mouth while presenting opportunities for customer feedback, cross-selling, and upselling.</div>
        <img class="onepic2" src="competitors.jpg">

        <div class="subtitlecontent2">To advance this project within our organization, we established two primary objectives.</div>

        <div class="subtitlecontent3"><a style="text-decoration: underline wavy black 1px;">Objective #1: Customer Return to Purchase Rate</a><br>We aim for our enrolled customers to actively engage with our comprehensive range of services and consistently reap the rewards with each purchase, thereby contributing to a high customer return rate.
        </div>
        <div class="subtitlecontent3"><a style="text-decoration: underline wavy black 1px;">Objective #2: Customer Entry Rate</a><br>We want to introduce our program to a wide range of customers, sparking their interest and encouraging them to join. We aim to present this as an exclusive and enticing opportunity, and unique and rewarding experience.

Within these varied touchpoints, we plan to integrate distinct content tailored to achieve specific objectives.<br><br>The touchpoints highlighted in green are strategically designed to include segments that actively promote our loyalty program, aiming to entice customers to join. Meanwhile, the areas marked in orange are focused on content that motivates customers to make purchases, effectively utilizing the benefits offered by the loyalty program.

            <div class="subtitleHeader2">Program Landing Page<br></div>
            <div class="subtitlecontent2">A landing page is essential when launching a new program. It should clearly present key information, including how the program operates, its benefits, and a Q&A section. I delved into various approaches to effectively introduce and highlight the program to potential participants.</div>

            <div class="subtitleHeader2">My Account vs. A New Page<br></div>
            <div class="subtitlecontent2">In crafting the logged-out version of the landing page, our aim was to provide an in-depth exploration of how the program operates and the advantages awaiting customers once they enroll. My design contributions encompassed creating modules for the hero section, program functionality explanation, benefits, and frequently asked questions. We also sought to incorporate information about the Museum of Modern Art membership, which offers additional perks to museum members.<br><br>Towards the page's conclusion, I integrated a product carousel. This addition serves the purpose of enticing customers who may require some contemplation before committing to the program. Viewing our product offerings is intended to spark their interest and encourage their participation.</div>

            <div class="subtitleHeader1">How to Combine the In-store and Online Experience?</div>
            <div class="subtitlecontent2">In contrast to online shopping, where points can be seamlessly redeemed during the checkout process, in-store customers are required to present a redemption code at the point of sale. Ideally, I envisioned one landing page for each store's signage, introducing the loyalty program while incorporating specific content about each individual store. (MoMA Design Store operates three physical stores in New York City, each offering a slightly distinct product selection and hosting unique store events.) <br><br>However, due to our constrained timeline and resource limitations, we must combine the in-store experience with the online experience, striking a balance between the two.</div>

            <div class="subtitleHeader2">Brand Identity</div>
            <div class="subtitlecontent2">One more thing to add – I also co-led the brand identity. The creative team started with two visual directions. One direction highlights MoMA Design Store’s core mission: “to bring good design into people’s lives by putting it into their homes and hands.” The other concept conveys the idea of a loyalty program visually. After two rounds of review with the marketing team, the second option was chosen to revise and refine.<br><br></div>
