            In my role as the Digital Design Manager within The Museum of Modern Art's retail department at MoMA Design Store, I took the helm in orchestrating the comprehensive design aspects of this project. This encompassed the realms of UI/UX design, branding, and the creation of social media content. My collaborative efforts extended to working closely with the art director, overseeing a team of one designer, and establishing productive partnerships with stakeholders across various departments to initiate and develop this program from its inception.

        <div class="subtitleHeader1">Problem & Challenge</div>
        <div class="subtitlecontent1">During 2021 and 2022, the customer return rate at the MoMA Design Store consistently remained below the industry average of 16.5%. In response to this, the team made the decision to introduce a new loyalty program aimed at improving both customer retention and engagement.<br><br>The primary obstacle we faced with this project was the tight timeline. We initiated the project in February 2022 and successfully concluded it by September of the same year.</div>

        <div class="subtitleHeader2">Website User Flow</div>
        <div class="subtitlecontent2">We initially outlined the fundamental digital experience, with plans to create a new landing page for the loyalty program aimed at both new customers and logged-out users. The goal was to provide information about the program and integrate it with the existing customer profile page.<br><br>However, this user journey necessitated more development work than the team's current capacity could accommodate. To streamline and enhance the process, I proposed a solution: merging the logged-out landing page with the logged-in landing page. This way, only a select few content modules would require dynamic elements, while the original customer profile page remains unchanged.<br><br></div>

        <div class="subtitlecontent1">We dynamically feature the program on the evergreen global nav skinny banner, homepage hero, and a banner at the bottom of the homepage (after we switch the homepage hero to another theme). New and returning customers see different copy versions that are more relevant to them.</div>

    <div class="subtitlecontent2">In crafting the logged-out version of the landing page, our aim was to provide an in-depth exploration of how the program operates and the advantages awaiting customers once they enroll. My design contributions encompassed creating modules for the hero section, program functionality explanation, benefits, and frequently asked questions. We also sought to incorporate information about the Museum of Modern Art membership, which offers additional perks to museum members.<br><br>Towards the page's conclusion, I integrated a product carousel. This addition serves the purpose of enticing customers who may require some contemplation before committing to the program. Viewing our product offerings is intended to spark their interest and encourage their participation.<br><br></div>

        <div class="subtitleHeader1">How to Combine the In-store and Online Experience?</div>
        <div class="subtitlecontent1">In contrast to online shopping, where points can be seamlessly redeemed during the checkout process, in-store customers are required to present a redemption code at the point of sale. Ideally, I envisioned one landing page for each store's signage, introducing the loyalty program while incorporating specific content about each individual store. (MoMA Design Store operates three physical stores in New York City, each offering a slightly distinct product selection and hosting unique store events.) <br><br> However, due to our constrained timeline and resource limitations, we must combine the in-store experience with the online experience, striking a balance between the two.</div>

        <div class="subtitleHeader1">Brand Identity</div>
        <div class="subtitlecontent1">Led by the Art Director and me, the creative team explored two visual directions. The first direction highlights MoMA Design Store’s core mission: “to bring good design into people’s lives by putting it into their homes and hands.” The other concept conveys the idea of a loyalty program visually. After two rounds of review with the marketing team, the second option was chosen to revise and refine.<br><br></div>
