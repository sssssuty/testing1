        <div class="content" id="content1">We normally think about out of control results when we hear the word 'random'. However, in programming language, the random function is followed by an interval. The interval actually has full control of the results. To play with the tension between in-control and out-of-control, I explore various mediums to present the idea.

        <br><br>Poster below is made by the randomization function in Cinema 4D after I imported all images. Similar to the concept of conceptual art, I made the poster below but I also did not make it on my own.

        <br><br>My first 'Random(control,control);' project is the book below. I played with different results I can get, with my programming skills in Javascript + p5.js library. 
        <br>The book is loosely binded by fastners. There are 6 chapters, position, angle, path, scale, color, and perspective. Each chapter contains: 2 paragraphs of suede code (in normal printing papers, single-sided); sample data (in transparent papers, single-sided); 12 randomized results (in normal printing papers, double-sided).

        <br><br>I focused on type for the last project of the series. I started with Racoco, an all-cap handlettering typeface. Each letter contains three variations. I used the OpenType feature to mimic the randomization operation to give uncontrolled result.

        <br><br>However, I want to challenge the concept of variable further. What if it is something I truely can not control? Like how many people are riding bikes, or how many popcorns are put into the box, or the weather. With XXXX library in Java, my experiments are listed below. Temperature of the input city controls the radius of the dots, and wind speed controls the speed of the dots moving around.
